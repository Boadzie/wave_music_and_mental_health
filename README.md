> This project contains the analysis and dashboard of the music and mental health dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/catherinerasgaitis/mxmh-survey-results)

## Hypothesis

> Music can have an effect on mental health

## Project Objectives

1. Determine whether music has effect on mental health

2. Collect and clean data using `siuba` and `pandas`

3. Manipulate the data the R way with `siuba`

4. Visualize the result with `seaborn` and `Plotly`

5. Build a dashboard to tell the story in the data with `h2o_wave`

## Project Description

### Step 1: Get data from Kaggle

### Step 2: Clean data(available in the `music_effect_on_mental.ipynb` file)

### Step 3: Manipulate and analyze the data using `siuba` and `pandas` (available in the `music_effect_on_mental.ipynb` file)

### Step 4: Visualize the result with `seaborn` and `Plotly` (available in the `music_effect_on_mental.ipynb` file)

### Step 5: Build a dashboard to present your finds using `h2o_wave` (available in the `src` folder)

## Running the project(Dashbord)

1. create a virtual environment with the command:

```bash
python3 -m venv .myenv
```

2. Activate the virtual environment

```bash
source .myenv/bin/activate
```

3. Navigate to the `src` folder and run:

```bash
wave run app_grid.py
```
